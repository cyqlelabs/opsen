# Opsen Load Balancer Client Configuration

# Load balancer server URL
server_url: http://lb.example.com:8080

# Optional: Override endpoint URL
# If not set, will auto-construct from local IP as http://{local_ip}:11000
# Examples:
#   endpoint_url: https://192.168.1.10:11000
#   endpoint_url: http://10.0.0.5:8080
# endpoint_url: ""

# Geolocation configuration (optional)
# Option 1: Skip geolocation entirely (fastest, no distance-based routing)
# skip_geolocation: true

# Option 2: Use MaxMind GeoLite2 database (recommended to avoid API rate limits)
# Download using: ./scripts/download-geoip.sh YOUR_LICENSE_KEY
# Get a free license key: https://www.maxmind.com/en/geolite2/signup
# geoip_db_path: ./GeoLite2-City.mmdb

# Option 3: Use ipapi.co API (default, but has rate limits: 150 requests/day)
# Automatically used if skip_geolocation is false and geoip_db_path is not set

# Unique client identifier (auto-generated if not specified)
# client_id: ""

# Hostname override (uses system hostname if not specified)
# hostname: ""

# Time window for averaging metrics in minutes
# Metrics are collected every second and averaged over this window
window_minutes: 15

# Report interval in seconds
# How often to send stats to the server
report_interval_seconds: 60

# Disk path to monitor
# Use "/" for root filesystem or a specific mount point
disk_path: /

# Log level (debug, info, warn, error, fatal)
# Use "debug" to see detailed geolocation and metrics information
log_level: info

# Skip TLS certificate verification (for self-signed certificates in development)
# WARNING: Only use in development! In production, use proper certificates.
# insecure_tls: false

# Server authentication key (must match server's server_key)
# If the server has server_key configured, this MUST match that value
# Leave empty if server has no authentication
# All clients connecting to the same server should use the same server_key
# server_key: ""
#
# Example production setup (must match server configuration):
# server_key: "shared-secret-for-all-clients-change-me"
